## About

You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on some web site, and only those who know will understand it. For maximum security, the message itself can be encrypted, as well.
